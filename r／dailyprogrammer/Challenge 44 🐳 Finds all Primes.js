/* 
    Write a function that takes two arguments a and b, and finds all primes that are between a and a + b,
    specifically, find all primes p such that a ≤ p < a + b, 
    for instance, for a = 1234 and b = 100, it should return the following 15 primes:
        ⮡  1237, 1249, 1259, 1277, 1279, 1283, 1289, 1291, 1297, 1301, 1303, 1307, 1319, 1321, 1327
        
    The sum of those primes are 19339. The number of primes for a = 9! and b = 8! is 3124 and the sum of those primes is 1196464560.
    
    How many primes are there for a = 16! and b = 10!, and what is their sum?

    📑 Note 1: In this problem, n! refers to the factorial of n, 1*2*3*...*(n-1)*n, so 9! is equal to 362880.
    📑 Note 2: All numbers and solutions in this problem fit into 64-bit integers.
