/* 
    Imagine each letter and its position within the alphabet, now assign each letter its corresponding value ie a=1, b=2,... z=26,
    when given a list of words, order the words by the sum of the values of the letters in their names.

    Example: Shoe and Hat
        ‚Æ°  Hat:  8+1+20    = 29
           Shoe: 19+8+15+5 = 47

    So the order would be Hat, Shoe.

    üçë  Bonus: Divide by the sum by the number of letters in that word and then rank them.
