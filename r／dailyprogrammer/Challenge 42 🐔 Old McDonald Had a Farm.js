/* 
    Write a program that prints out the lyrics for "Ninety-nine bottles of beer", "Old McDonald had a farm" or "12 days of Christmas".
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer)
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_MacDonald_Had_a_Farm)
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song))

    If you choose "Ninety-nine bottles of beer", you need to spell out the number, not just write the digits down,
    it's "Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall", not "99 bottles of beer"!

    For Old McDonald, you need to include at least 6 animals: a cow, a chicken, a turkey, a kangaroo, a T-Rex and an animal of your choosing, 
    The cow goes "moo", the chicken goes "cluck", the turkey goes "gobble", the kangaroo goes "g'day mate" and the T-Rex goes "GAAAAARGH". 
    You can have more animals if you like.

    Make your code shorter than the song it prints out!
