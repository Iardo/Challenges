/* 
    Brainfuck is an extremely minimalistic programming language.
    The memory consists of a large array of bytes, the "tape", which is manipulated by moving around a single tape pointer. 
    The 8 commands are:
        <	move the pointer to the left
        >	move the pointer to the right
        +	increment the byte the pointer is pointing at (mod 256)
        -	decrement the byte the pointer is pointing at (mod 256)
        [	if the data which the tape pointer is pointing at is 0, jump forward to the command after the matching square bracket. Otherwise, just continue to the next command
        ]	if the data which the tape pointer is pointing at is not 0, jump backwards to the command after the matching square bracket. Otherwise, just continue to the next command
        ,	read a character from the input and store it into the current pointer byte
        .	output the current pointer byte as an ascii character
        any other character is ignored and treated as a comment

    [ ... ] thus make a kind of while loop, equivalent to something like "while(data[pointer] != 0) { ... }".
    The brackets match like parentheses usually do, each starting one has a matching ending one. These loops can be nested inside other loops.

    Write a program that reads a brainfuck program and its input, interprets the code, and returns the output.
