/* 
    Inspired by this Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule,
    i thought it would be cool to come up with a programme which uses the "Doomsday Algorithm" to determine which day of the week a certain date falls on.

    üçë  Bonus: Write another programme which takes parameters and give a random date; 
        if I say I want a date between 1900 and 2100 it may output: (17/3/2046)
        and then ask for you to enter the day of the week and have the programme tell you if you are correct.
