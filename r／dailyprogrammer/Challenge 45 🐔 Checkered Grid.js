/* 
    Your challenge today is to write a program that can draw a checkered grid (like a chessboard) to any dimension. 
    For instance, a 3 by 8 board might look like this:

        *********************************
        *   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
        *   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
        *   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
        *********************************
        *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *
        *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *
        *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *
        *********************************
        *   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
        *   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
        *   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
        *********************************

    Yours doesn't have to look like mine, you can make it look any way you want. 
    Also try to make it scalable, so that if you want to make a 2 by 5 board, but with bigger squares, it would print out:

        *******************************
        *     *#####*     *#####*     *
        *     *#####*     *#####*     *
        *     *#####*     *#####*     *
        *     *#####*     *#####*     *
        *     *#####*     *#####*     *
        *******************************
        *#####*     *#####*     *#####*
        *#####*     *#####*     *#####*
        *#####*     *#####*     *#####*
        *#####*     *#####*     *#####*
        *#####*     *#####*     *#####*
        *******************************
